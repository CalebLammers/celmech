Numerical Resonance Models
==========================

Introduction
------------

Approximate equations of motion governing the dynamics of a mean motion resonance
can be generated by including terms from a distrubing function expansion using the 
:class:`celmech.PoincareHamiltonian` class.

However, `celmech` also allows users to derive equations governing mean motion resonance dynamics without resorting to a truncated Taylor expansions in eccentricities and inclinations.
`celmech` provides two such classes, :class:`celmech.numerical_resonance_models.PlanarResonanceEquations` and
:class:`celmech.numerical_resonance_models.SpatialResonanceEquations`, are described below.

Planar Resonance Equations
--------------------------
 
:class:`celmech.numerical_resonance_models.PlanarResonanceEquations` provides equations of motion governing a mean-motion resonance between two coplanar planets.

Spatial Resonance Equations
---------------------------

:class:`celmech.numerical_resonance_models.SpatialResonanceEquations` provides equations of motion governing a mean-motion resonance between planets that may be on mutually inclined orbits.
